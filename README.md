## Description:

EasyBus is a Web application designed to provide users with real-time information about nearby bus routes, timings, and stops. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily plan their trips, find the closest bus stops, and track the arrival times of buses.

## Technologies Used:

+ React.js for frontend development.
+ Node.js with Express.js for backend development.
+ MongoDB Database for storing and retrieving user and transit data.
+ Google Maps API for mapping functionality.
+ Transit agency APIs for accessing bus route and timing data.

## Third Services Used:

+ MongoDB Database for storing and retrieving user and transit data.
+ Google Maps API for displaying bus routes and stops on a map.





## Schedule of Work:
We will use Trello to organize our tasks and track our progress. Here's our tentative schedule:

+ Project setup, database integration, and UI design.
+ Implementing real-time updates for bus timings, fetching and displaying bus routes, and stops.
+ Testing, bug fixes, and optimization.
+ Final testing, polishing UI, and deployment.

## Note:
****This project pitch is a preliminary outline and subject to further refinement and adjustments during the development process. We aim to deliver a high-quality and user-friendly web application within the specified timeframe. Thank you for considering EasyBus!****
